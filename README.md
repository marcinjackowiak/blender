# Unity Tools

This script is inspired by [Blender-UE4-FBX-Export](https://github.com/nikhil922/Blender-UE4-FBX-Export/blob/master/blender_unreal_fbx_batch_export.py)

But instead of the useful lod exporter it contains a batch exporter.

## batch exporter

Select a destination folder and click on "Batch Export". It will export all visible meshes to the destination folder with the mesh name as file name.
